# Solar-Blue
This is the repository of the files from my senior design project, a Bluetooth Headset 
with solar charging capabilities. I designed the program for the microcontroller, an 
AtMega328 model, while my partner designed the associated hardware for the headset. Upon 
implementation, everything but the Bluetooth Shutoff works fine.
